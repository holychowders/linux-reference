# Docker Example: Astroterm

This Docker example uses a Dockerfile to install `astroterm` into a Fedora container so I can test out the program. The `install` script builds an image from the Dockerfile and creates a symlink somewhere in my PATH to the `run` script so I can conveniently execute Astroterm later in my terminal.
